# Twenty-Twenty-Twenty - Eye Care Overlay App

A lightweight, non-intrusive app designed to support healthy eye habits by reminding you to take regular breaks.
It follows the 20-20-20 rule to reduce eye strain by prompting you every 20 minutes to look 20 feet (or 6 meters) away for 20 seconds without interrupting your workflow.

### Features
- **Subtle Overlay**: Displays a transparent countdown that doesnâ€™t steal focus or input.

- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.
